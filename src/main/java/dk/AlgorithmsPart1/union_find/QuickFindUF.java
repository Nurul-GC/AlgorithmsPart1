/**
 * QuickFindUF class
 *
 * @apiNote This is a class to illustrate Unionfind
 * @implNote This uses the eager approach
 * @author David Kariuki
 *
 * <p>
 * @note Data structure.
 * Integer array id[] of length N.
 * Interpretation: p and q are connected iff they have the same id.
 * <p>
 * @note Process.
 * Find - Check if p and q have the same id.
 * Union. To merge components containing p and q, change all entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q].
 * <p>
 * @note Speed.
 * Union find is too slow and too expensive
 * It takes N Squared array accesses to process a sequence of N union commands on N objects
 * Quadratic algorithms do not scale. They also don't scale with technology
 * <p>
 * @note Rough standard (for now).
 * 10^9 operations per second, 10^9 words of main memory.
 * Touch all words in approximately 1 second.
 * <p>
 * @note Huge problem for quick-find.
 * 109 union commands on 109 objects.
 * Quick-find takes more than 1018 operations.
 * 30+ years of computer time!
 * <p>
 * @note Quadratic algorithms don't scale with technology.
 * New computer may be 10x as fast, But, has 10x as much memory â‡’
 * Case: You want to solve a problem that is 10x as big. With quadratic algorithm, this takes 10x as long!
